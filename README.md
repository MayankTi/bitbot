## Articles

I wrote some articles about this project, please find it here:

* [Sending Money ? Thereâ€™s a Bot For That!](https://chatbotsmagazine.com/sending-money-now-theres-a-bot-for-that-4601168bfd14)
* [Building the Most Basic Bitcoin Wallet Ever (in Facebook Messenger)](https://chatbotsmagazine.com/building-the-most-basic-bitcoin-wallet-ever-in-facebook-messenger-a71014d46258)

## Test Setup

The chatbot is accessible [here](https://www.facebook.com/ItipuBot/) - Facebook account required, of course! 

## Tooling

There is not much tooling for now. It is deployed on Heroku.

    > heroku git:remote -a bitbottest
    > git push heroku master

## Looking for contributors

This project is still pretty basic. Looking for developers, testers, designers, blockchain experts, ... to take part!

I'm willing to share every server access (Heroku, Facebook Page, API.ai, ....) to organize a fully distributed development/test/deployment pipeline for contributors.
